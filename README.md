## Overview

Pwn Patrol Vulnerability Scanner is a personal project I've developed to learn more about web security and automated vulnerability detection. This tool is designed to help identify common vulnerabilities in web applications and networks, providing a detailed HTML report with findings.

**Please note:** This is my first repository on GitHub, and I am eager to learn from the community. Any feedback or suggestions you have are very much appreciated!

## Features

Pwn Patrol offers a range of features aimed at detecting common security vulnerabilities:

- **Open Port Scanning:** Identifies open ports that might expose services to potential attackers.
- **SQL Injection Detection:** Scans for SQL injection vulnerabilities, which can allow attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:** Detects XSS vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized script execution.
- **Outdated Software Detection:** Checks for outdated server software versions that may be susceptible to known exploits.
- **Insecure HTTP Methods Detection:** Identifies potentially dangerous HTTP methods that could be misused.
- **VirusTotal Reputation Check:** Looks up the domain’s reputation using VirusTotal’s database.
- **Directory Traversal Detection:** Scans for directory traversal vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive files.
- **File Inclusion Vulnerability Detection (LFI/RFI):** Detects potential local or remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.
- **HTTP Security Headers Check:** Ensures that the target server is configured with recommended security headers.
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Enumerates potential subdomains to uncover additional attack surfaces.

## Important

For the Pwn Patrol Vulnerability Scanner to generate the HTML report correctly, the `report_template.html` file must be placed in the same directory as the `pwnpatrol.py` script. The script relies on this template file to create the HTML report, so it's essential that both files are in the same location.

When you run the scanner, the generated HTML reports will be saved in the same directory. Each report will be named based on the target URL or IP address and will include a report number (e.g., `example.com_report_01.html`). This naming convention helps in organizing and identifying multiple reports easily. Future updates will include more efficient reporting options, such as PDF reports and enhanced file naming conventions, to further improve the usability and organization of the generated reports.

**VirusTotal API Key**

To use the VirusTotal reputation check feature in Pwn Patrol, you will need to obtain an API key from VirusTotal. The VirusTotal API is used to check the reputation of domains, providing an additional layer of analysis during the vulnerability scan.

**Steps to Obtain and Use the API Key:**

1. **Sign Up for an API Key:**
   - Visit [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and sign up for a free account.
   - Once registered, you can obtain your API key from your account settings.

2. **Add the API Key to the Script:**
   - Open the `pwnpatrol.py` script.
   - Locate the following line of code:
     ```
     VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key'
     ```
   - Replace `'your_virustotal_api_key'` with the API key you obtained from VirusTotal.

3. **Save the Script:**
   - After adding your API key, save the `pwnpatrol.py` script.

This API key is essential for the VirusTotal reputation check to function properly. Without it, the tool will not be able to retrieve reputation data from VirusTotal, which will limit its effectiveness.

## Technical Details

Pwn Patrol is built using Python 3.x and outputs its results in a structured HTML report. The tool features an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that guides you through the scanning process.

### **Languages and Frameworks:**

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jinja2 (for HTML report generation)**

### **Output Format:**

- **HTML Report:** An organized and easy-to-read report summarizing the scan results.

## Dependencies

To run Pwn Patrol, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `re`: For regex operations (built-in Python module).
- `socket`: For network operations (built-in Python module).
- `time`: For timing operations (built-in Python module).
- `os`: For file and directory operations (built-in Python module).
- `urllib.parse`: For URL parsing (built-in Python module).
- `BeautifulSoup (bs4)`: For HTML parsing.
- `Jinja2`: For generating HTML reports.

### **Install Dependencies:**

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install requests bs4 jinja2
```
## Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/clxqcore/pwnpatrol.git
cd pwnpatrol
```
Step 2: Install Depdendencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 3: Make the Script Executable
```
chmod +x pwnpatrol.py
```
Step 4: Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH
```
sudo mv pwnpatrol.py /user/local/bin/pwnpatrol
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start Pwn Patrol by typing `pwnpatrol` in your terminal:

```
pwnpatrol
```
### CLI Commands

`1`. Set Target URL: Specify the target URL for the scan.

`2`. Run Scan: Begin scanning the target for vulnerabilities.

`3`. Show Options: Display available commands.

`4`. Exit: Exit the Pwn Patrol CLI.

After the scan, an HTML report will be generated in the working directory, providing a summary of the findings.

## Future Updates

I'm planning to continually improve Pwn Patrol by adding new features and enhancing its capabilities. Here are some of the updates I'm considering:

**Expanding Port Scanning:**

- Include a broader range of ports in the scan to detect services running on non-standard ports.
- Allow users to specify custom port ranges for scanning.
  
**Adding More Vulnerability Tests:**

- Implement additional checks for vulnerabilities like:
- Brute Force Protection Checks: Test for weak password policies and login rate limiting.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) Detection: Identify potential RCE vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Session Management Vulnerabilities: Test for issues like insecure cookies and session fixation.

**AI Integration:**

- Explore the integration of AI to improve the accuracy of vulnerability detection.
- Use machine learning to predict potential vulnerabilities based on previous scan results and industry trends.

**User Feedback Implementation:**

- Based on feedback, I'll be focusing on refining existing features and adding user-requested enhancements.
